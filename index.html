                        First thing I was gratuated from gymnasium the 4th of Witebsk in 2012. In 2017 I became a physicist in BSU, later, in a year, - master of the computer science in BSTU. 
                        <br> Now I'm a PhD Student of BSTU as a theoretical physicist.
                        <br> I was trained in various online courses such as <strong>Udemy</strong>, <Strong>DataCamp</Strong>, <strong>Codecademy</strong> in most cases for learning Python.

                    <p>
                        All of us are living in the rapidly changing, developing world. This world has actually plenty of possibilities, 
                        so goals and wishes for everybody are to find their own way, but for me, this way has many directions. 
                        I mean that I would like to save my name in each areas in which I can, to remain "immortal".
                        <br>
                        From childhood I used to like to discover the world. And now I've almost become a PhD in the theoretical physics. 
                        Furthermore, I like painting, cooking, playing several musicial instrument (piano, tuba, drums).
                        <br>    
                        My potential will increase every year while the engine is buzzing in my a.. inside me.

                <p>
                    All my programming experience is based on writing programs for simulating physicochemical systems, 
                    which I study as part of working in the European Horizon program and writing my PhD thesis. Published work results can be found <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ve8e6CIAAAAJ&hl=ru"> here </a>.
